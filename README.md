An open-access technical writing textbook

This is my first published version of my open-access textbook. Lord willing, once I have my tenure project complete, 
I plan on readdressing this and reworking it on Github as a truely open-source and open-access text that is native to
the web via Bookdown or an equivant tool. For now, here is the current copy. It has issues and errors, but it is at least
a start to a project I'm passionate about reworking fundamnetally in the future.
